# YSM_SERVER
 Allow everyone to play YSM on Spigot/Paper Core server

This Network Server uses Freesia. You can find it on the YSM Wiki.
Link: https://ysm.cfpa.team/wiki/freesia-plugin/

This includes 4 Folders that have been basically set up.
You will start the sub servers in the following order by clicking on the ***Run.bat*** files in the Folders

**PROXY_VELOCITY** -> **MODULE_FABRIC_WORKER** -> **SUBSERVER_LOBBY_PAPERMC** -> **SUBSERVER_MAIN_PURPUR**

Basically, it doesn't include any other plugins besides ViaVersion, ViaBackwar and FreeSia. 
You will have to add your own plugins like Luckperms, Essentials, WorldEdit, WorldGuard, etc.

The **Lobby** will be the server that every player connects to first when entering your server. 
From here they will go to other servers. For example: Survival, Faction, Minigame, ...

If you want to expand your server. For example, add another server into your Server Network.
You just need to copy the Purpur server. Then customize it to your liking.
Or if you already have knowledge about Proxy Velocity and server setup, you can create a new server yourself.

I also accept do server setup for you at a reasonable price. If you need help. Contact me on Discord: **@NguyenDevs**
